## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zichang, and I'm a PhD candidate in the Statistical Science program at Southern Methodist University.

<!--  Research: high-dimensional time series analysis focusing on developmental disorders. -->
- Take a look at some of the projects I've completed: 
    * Time series analysis:
      
      a. Neuroimaging data: [ADHD](https://github.com/Zichang23/adhd), [ASD](https://github.com/Zichang23/fmri)
      
      b. [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/Zichang23/PredictHousePrice)
      
    * Data science projects:
      
         a. [Optimizing Crop Selection with Predictive Modeling](https://github.com/Zichang23/sklearn_predict)

         b. [National Hockey Leagueâ€™s(NHL) API](https://github.com/Zichang23/Project-1)

         c. [Bike Sharing Predictive Modeling](https://github.com/AlexSelwaeh/ST558Project2)

         d. [House Price Predictive Modeling and Visualization](https://github.com/Zichang23/Project-3)

<!--    * Bayesian hierarchical modelling:

      

#### Current Research

I specialize in high-dimensional time series analysis focusing on developmental disorders (ASD and ADHD). My research employs advanced spectral analysis techniques and custom visualization tools to extract meaningful patterns from complex datasets.

#### Technical Contributions

I have developed and maintain several R functions that implement novel analytical methods for neurological time series data. These tools facilitate robust statistical inference in high-dimensional spaces while ensuring computational efficiency.

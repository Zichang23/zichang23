## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zichang, and I'm a Statistics PhD candidate at Southern Methodist University. Here are some projects I've completed:

<!--  Research: high-dimensional time series analysis focusing on developmental disorders. --> 
- Time Series Analysis:

  * Neuroimaging data: [ADHD](https://github.com/Zichang23/adhd), [ASD](https://github.com/Zichang23/fmri)
  * [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/Zichang23/PredictHousePrice)
      
- Data Science Projects:

  * [Optimizing Crop Selection with Predictive Modeling](https://github.com/Zichang23/sklearn_predict)
  * [National Hockey Leagueâ€™s(NHL) API](https://github.com/Zichang23/Project-1)
  * [Bike Sharing Predictive Modeling](https://github.com/AlexSelwaeh/ST558Project2)
  * [House Price Predictive Modeling and Visualization](https://github.com/Zichang23/Project-3)

<!--    * Bayesian hierarchical modelling:

      

#### Current Research

I specialize in high-dimensional time series analysis focusing on developmental disorders (ASD and ADHD). My research employs advanced spectral analysis techniques and custom visualization tools to extract meaningful patterns from complex datasets.

#### Technical Contributions

I have developed and maintain several R functions that implement novel analytical methods for neurological time series data. These tools facilitate robust statistical inference in high-dimensional spaces while ensuring computational efficiency.

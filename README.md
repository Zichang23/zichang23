## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zichang, and I'm a PhD candidate in the Statistical Science program at Southern Methodist University.

- Iâ€™m currently working on high-dimensional time series analysis focusing on developmental disorders.
- I recently developed several R functions that implement novel analytical methods for neurological time series data. Check them out: [ADHD]https://github.com/Zichang23/adhd, [ASD]https://github.com/Zichang23/fmri 

<!--
#### Current Research

I specialize in high-dimensional time series analysis focusing on developmental disorders (ASD and ADHD). My research employs advanced spectral analysis techniques and custom visualization tools to extract meaningful patterns from complex datasets.

#### Technical Contributions

I have developed and maintain several R functions that implement novel analytical methods for neurological time series data. These tools facilitate robust statistical inference in high-dimensional spaces while ensuring computational efficiency.
